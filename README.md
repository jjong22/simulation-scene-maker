# simulation-scene-maker
Scene maker for several game/robotics simulators.

## overview
This file is the part of my research. To create a consistent scene in several simulators, I need some middle interface software. This program can make _same_ (at least similar) scene for these 5 simulators.

## information
Import scene-make-functions from `utils.py`, and construct scene in the `main.py`. 
Specific information will be added when I developed.
